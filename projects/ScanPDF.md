**Scan PDF** is an iOS application that allows users to scan physical documents, enhance captured images, extract text using OCR, and save or share documents as PDFs. The app provides a complete document scanning workflow directly on the device—turning photos into clean, readable, and searchable PDFs.

With built-in image enhancement, cropping, and text recognition, Scan PDF simplifies document digitization for personal and professional use, while offering cloud-backed storage and premium features through in-app purchases.
