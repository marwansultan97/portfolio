## SlowMo

**Category:** Media / Video Editing

**SlowMo** is a video editing iOS application that allows users to create and edit videos directly on their device. The app provides a full set of editing tools including trimming, cropping, rotating, adding music, and overlaying text—enabling users to produce polished videos with ease.

A key feature of SlowMoVid is its custom speed ramping system, which allows users to apply precise fast or slow motion effects across different sections of a video, giving creators fine-grained control over playback speed and visual impact.
