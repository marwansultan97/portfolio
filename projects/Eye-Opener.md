**Eye-Opener** is a lightweight iOS application designed to help users expand their peripheral vision and reduce eye, neck, and mental tension caused by prolonged focused work. When working on a computer or reading, users often fixate on a narrow visual area, which can lead to strain and fatigue over time.

The app encourages a healthier visual habit by displaying subtle moving visual cues in the user’s peripheral vision. By responding to these cues while continuing their primary task, users gradually retrain their visual awareness and improve overall comfort during long work sessions.
